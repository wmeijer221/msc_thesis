    "One of the critical points of feedback on our process is that we use multiple models.\n",
    "We use these models to clearly distinguish between the types of variables we're testing: ecosystem contributions (in general, and in (non-)dependent projects) and collaboration metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In part, this was done because variables correlated, thus affecting the model's quality.\n",
    "This notebook explores how this correlation can be resolved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the results of [the revised ecosystem model](./python_proj/modelling/notebooks/single_model_experimentation/ecosystem_model.ipynb), it shows that `ln(1 + WeightedEcosystemSecondOrderDegreeCentrality)` and `ln(1 + EcosystemExperienceSubmitterPullRequestSubmissionCount)` linearly correlate with a Spearman coefficient $\\rho$ of $0.748$, which is substantial.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal 1:** The problem that we try to solve in this notebook is to remove this correlation without losing insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal 2:** A secondary objective here is to make the metric fully undirectional (w.r.t. directed vs. undirected graphs) as the original metric considered directed $\\lambda$-edges and undirected $\\mu$-edges.\n",

    "such that the first-order degree of all neighbors of $x$ are summed, minus the edges that connect $x$ and $y$.\n",
    "This sum is then normalized by the number of ecosystem-spanning $\\lambda$-edges that $x$ has (i.e., $|R_\\lambda(x, p)|$); theoretically, this should remove correlation between the degree of $x$ and their second-order degree centrality.\n",
